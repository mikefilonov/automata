# Pharo Automata
Microservices automation framework - the "main" function to drive external APIs.

Automata allows a Pharo developer to write automation scripts for external microservices (or APIs like twitter, google, or any) in Pharo. The project main idea is inspired by Seaside ```WATask``` class which allows coding of a complex communication in workflow based style.

The concept is some kind of a state machine which drives external services via (REST) API and changes it's state  based on events recieved back. The state machine is represented by a Smalltalk code and "waitForEvent:" method which saves current execution state and resumes it upon a recieving of an event.

Automata state machine can be hooked to any event system by inheriting ```AMTaskManager``` and implementing ```callbacks``` protocol.

As an example implementaion see ```AMManualTaskManager``` class which implements a FIFO queue for pending tasks and manual event triggering.

##Installation

```
Metacello new baseline: #Automata; repository: 'github://mikefilonov/automata'; load.
```

## Quick start

You may find an full-fledged example for external service automation here: https://github.com/mikefilonov/automata-example

The following is an example of Automata only and uses ```AMManualTaskManager``` implementation to run tasks. Note that in scope of this example by term "event" we mean an explicit call to "doNext" method.

```smalltalk
automata := AMManualTaskManager new.
automata do: [ :task |
	Transcript show: 'Hello'.
	task wait: nil.
	Transcript show: 'World!'.
	].

automata do: [ :task |
	Transcript show: 'Goodbye'.
	task wait: nil.
	Transcript show: 'Cruel'.
	task wait: nil.
	Transcript show: 'World :('.	
	task wait: nil.
	].

automata start.

automata doNext.
automata doNext.
automata doNext.
automata doNext.

automata stop.
```


## Using Automata

### ```#do:``` and ```#doTask:``` methods
A task manager (AMTaskManager subclasses) is used to track execution of many tasks. In order to start a new task ```doTask:``` method is used. The method accepts one argument a AMTask subclass instance to run.

```smalltalk
automata doTask: ProcessNewMailTask new. "a class I made up to show the point of running subclasses of AMTask"
```

```do:``` method is a shorthand for adding a ```AMDeligateTask``` instance by providing a one-argument code block.

```smalltalk
automata do: [ :task |
    task waitForEvent: [ :e | e selector = #ToDoItemAdded and: [ e list = 'planned' ] ].
    ]
```

The code is equavalent to the following:
```smalltalk
automata doTask: (AMDeligateTask new taskBlock: [ :task |
    task waitForEvent: [ :e | e selector = #ToDoItemAdded and: [ e list = 'planned' ] ].
    ]; yourself)
```


### ```#wait:``` and ```#waitForEvent:``` methods

Automata task saves it's state using ```wait:``` method called in a Task code. This method accepts 1 argument (condition) which is not restricted to any class by the framework but defined by a concrete imoplementation of an event system. The argument purpose is to define a resume condition of the stop point. The intended way to use it is one-argument block which accepts an event and returns ```true``` or ```false``` depending on if the event matches the expected description.

```waitForEvent:``` is an helper method which assumes that condition is to be a block with one argument (suposedly an event) and returns the argument for which the block answered ```true```.

```
event := task waitForEvent: [:event | event selector = #FileUploaded].
Transcript show: (event at: #filename).
```

### AMTaskManager callback protocol

To implement an new automata manager for an event system create a new AMTaskManager subclass and re-implement ```addPendingTask: aTask withState: cc withCondition: condition```

where
- ```aTask``` is a AMTask instance which represents the code flow and can be used to store some flow-specific properties like "task name".
- ```cc``` is a Continuation which should be used to resume the task.
- ```condition``` is a condition to resume the flow. Defined by the concrete implementation.

This method is called whenever a task reaches ```wait:``` method. In a response a task manager is supposed to save the task in a "pending tasks" collection and resume it when event matching ```condition``` is recieved.

The framework does not provide a default implenentation to store and resume tasks though. This means the task manager implementation must have some kind of a queue for tasks and event processor which runs through conditions and put matched ```cc``` to execution loop queue.

### Resuming a pending task

In order to resume a saved task it's latest ```cc``` should be put to an execution loop queue:

```smalltalk
automata executionLoop enqueue: cc
```


## Implementation details

By default Automata implements single-threaded execution loop in which runable tasks are queued and exected in FIFO order.
